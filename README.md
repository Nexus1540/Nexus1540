# 🇵🇱 Filip Kornacki

## 🜁 Hermetic Mind. Builder’s Precision.

I'm calm by nature. I watch first, think second, act third.
I don’t talk much — I prefer when the work speaks for me.

Since 2015, I’ve been blending technical instinct (Python, algorithms, AI) with strategic thinking. I’m not chasing certificates. I’m not building a façade. I care only about what works.

* **🎮 Gamedev:** learning Godot and shaping small worlds at my own quiet pace.
* **💻 Tech Base:** Python, predictive models, TypeScript, PyTorch.
* **🧩 Principle:** less noise, more results.

## 🜂 A Few Things About Me

> "If a mountain trail doesn’t hit 185 BPM, it’s just a walk."

I like effort. I like steep climbs. Silence to think. A rhythm that forces focus.
